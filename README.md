# System-Number-Generator
Basic system-number generator with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Have you ever wanted to do tasks with number system, but can't think of numbers or you want to be trully random? Well I feel your pain, so that's why I build this little 
app for you :). Use it to train you number system/math skills.   

Download it using Git clone and just use VSCODE or whatever IDE you want to use and start generating number and gaining skills :).
